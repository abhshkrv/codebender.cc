<h1>{{site_name}} <small>so what&#39;s the deal?</small></h1>
<div>
	<p>{{ site_name }} is a web platform for embedded software development, aimed at developers, artists, makers and hardware enthusiasts, and we think it is the next step to the maker revolution. It allows you to join the maker revolution and start building a cool hardware project, like an automated grill, a cat feeder, bike GPS or your very own weather station, by simplifying Arduino programming. We want to lower the barrier to entry, which is necessary to help everyday people start their first project, become makers and advance technology instead of using it. {{ site_name }} requires no installation, so you can get started with Arduino programming the minute you get one in your hands! And with the development tools we provide, you can do so faster and easier! {{ site_name }} also stores your code on the cloud, so it’s safe and accessible from anywhere, anytime. Here's a small list of features:</p>

	    <h2>Code</h2>
	    <p>{{ site_name }} uses Ace, an awesome web code editor written in pure HTML5 and Javascript, which is the best thing ever since sliced bread, at least as far as code editors go. Use it now and enjoy indentation that just works™, great syntax highlighting, auto-completion, highlighting of matching parentheses and brackets and highlighting of a selected keyword. Oh, and of course, you can't call it an editor if it doesn't have Vim and EMACS keybindings. Built-in.</p>

	    <h2>Compile</h2>
	    <p>Compile your code, on the cloud. With {{ site_name }}, you can compile your code on our servers, saving you the hassle of downloading and installing all the necessary tools to build your sketches. No more upgrading to newer versions and managing incompatible library versions. This also improves compilation times in old machines and simplifies syntax error checks.</p>

	    <h2>Built-in Libraries</h2>
	    <p>Never mind about finding, installing, and updating external libraries anymore. With {{ site_name }}, you only need to include the library you want to use, and we automatically compile it with your code. And we also take care of updating them when a new version is released. All just for you. Stop worrying about libraries, and start coding your Arduino. That autonomous space BBQ laser grill isn't going to build itself, you know.</p>

	    <h2>Advanced Code Analysis</h2>
	    <p>{{ site_name }} uses Clang, a state-of-the-art C++ code analyzer and compiler to perform syntax analysis in your programs, and give you precise and accurate information on your bugs. Using {{ site_name }}'s improved reporting on the faulty lines of code, you can find and squash bugs in no time. Using {{site_name}}, you can now get more precise reports on your errors, and better suggestions on how to fix them.</p>

	    <h2>Documentation and Suggestions</h2>
	    <p>{{site_name}} makes finding the documentation for that one function you are looking for as easy as it can get. Just select it, press Ctrl-Space, and you will be take to its arduino.cc Reference page. And it gets better. We are actively documenting Arduino's codebase, in order to provide a better reference, as well as suggestions and auto-completion in the near future.</p>

	    <h2>Cloud Architecture</h2>
	    <p>{{site_name}} is built from the ground up with a Cloud perspective. We use the best engineering practices to be scalable, fast, responsive, stable, and safe. We use top notch technology and the best infrastructure, to make sure that your data is safe and our website runs smoothly 24/7. We will be online whenever you need us, and you will never have to back up your sketches, or worry about losing your data due to hardware faults again.</p>

	    <h2>Flashing</h2>
	    <p>Upload your code to your Arduino, straight from your browser. No inconvenient software installations needed to flash your sketch on your Arduino board. All you need to do is run our Java applet straight from your browser, and you gain immediate access to your Serial ports to Upload your sketch, or open the Serial Monitor to communicate with your Arduino.</p>

	    <h2>Remote Flashing</h2>
	    <p>Still using your USB port to flash your new sketches on your Arduino? Come on, that is sooo 2010. Meet Ariadne! Our open-source bootloader that uses the TFTP protocol to flash the Arduino Ethernet and Arduinos with Ethernet Shield. Using the Ariadne bootloader you can upload your sketch to any internet-connected Arduino, anywhere in the world, straight from {{ site_name }}. Add your Ethernet-equipped Arduino to your list and you are set.</p>
