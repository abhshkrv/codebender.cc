			<h3>Code</h3>
			<h4>State of the art editor. Awesome compiler.</h4>
			<p>
				{{ site_name }} provides you with great development tools to help you code faster and easier, and finish
				what you are building faster, so you can move on to other cool stuff. We offer a state of the art
				editor, with great syntax highlighting,  indentation, code completion <small>(coming soon)</small>,
				code folding, and other cool things. If you have no idea what we're talking about, let's just say,
				it's a great editor, and you feel that when you use it.
			</p>
			<p>
				But we don't just stay at the editor. With {{ site_name }}, you can compile your code much faster. No
				need to install anything. No need to manage libraries and tools made in the 90s. Just use our wicked
				fast, online compiler and get the work done.
			</p>
			<p>
				Not only that, but we're also helping you squash your bugs faster too. Noone writes perfect code from
				the first try, and trying to understand exactly what you're doing wrong can get hard. {{ site_name }}
				is using Clang, a great, new, shinny, open-source compiler for C/C++/Obj-C by Apple. We're using Clang
				to give you much a better error output when things go wrong, so you can pinpoint the mistake, and why
				your code doesn't compile. No more cryptic messages, no more vague error outputs.
			</p>

			<h3>Deploy</h3>
			<h4>Hassle-free. USB cable or the cloud. It doesn't matter.</h4>
			<p>
				Traditionally, you would need to install an IDE, which includes the software that flashes your program
				to your device, find and install the correct drivers for Windows or Mac OS X, set the correct
				permissions if you're on Linux, etc. If you're lucky, it can be done in 10 minutes. If you're not,
				it can be a total mess.
			</p>
			<p>
				With {{ site_name }}, you can program your Arduino straight from your browser. No need to manage
				libraries and drivers. No need to find and update them either. {{ site_name }} does that for you. So
				kick back, write some code, and then deploy it to your device. All you need to do is install our browser
				plugin and follow our
				<a href="{{ path("AceStaticBundle_walkthrough", {"page": 1}) }}">Getting Started</a>
				guide, which takes care of all the hassle and guides you through for the first time. From having
				an Arduino, to having a programmed Arduino.
			</p>
			<p>
				After installing the pluggin, you can even flash other people's sketches to your device, straight from
				your browser. See the code bellow? You could load that to your device, straight from this page!
			</p>
			<p>
				But it gets better. If you have an Arduino Ethernet, Arduino & Ethernet Shield, or any other compatible
				device, you can also program it through the network, from anywhere in the world, using our "Cloud Flash"
				feature.

			<h3>Do It Together</h3>
			<h4>From DIY to DIT. Share and Collaborate.</h4>
			<p>
				You're building something awesome. Why keep it to yourself? With {{ site_name }}, you can share your
				code with the rest of the world. First and foremost, you can make your code available to others, to
				build upon and hack to their needs, or just improve it and send those changes back to you.
			</p>
			<p>
				Of course, that means you can also search for existing projects and get ideas from what others are
				building. If you're building an automatic pet feeder for your vacations, chances are someone has already
				built something similar. Why start from scratch?
			</p>
			<p>
				Last but not least, you can embed code in your website, blog, or tutorials. Show people the exact code
				you're using and make your posts more interesting.
			</p>
			<p>
				In fact, that's exactly what we did on the left.
			</p>
			<p>
				They can also download your code and use it
				themselves. But why do that when they can even program their devices with your code, straight from your
				website! Or clone your sketch in codebender and modify it. Stop asking people to download and copy-paste
				your code, and make your blog posts and tutorials more interactive.
