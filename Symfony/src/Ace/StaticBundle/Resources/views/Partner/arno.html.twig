				Learning the basics of electronics and programming is challenging. Learning them while juggling piles of
				tiny parts, jumper wires, and breadboards is even more difficult. With the Arno, we've gotten rid of the
				piles of parts. Everything you need to learn Arduino and complete interesting projects in already built
				in. The board comes fully assembled, ready to plug in with the included USB cable. You can focus on
				learning how the circuits work and learning the Arduino language. You can tackle the piles of parts
				once you're ready.
